# Kosaraju-s-Algorithm
The code don't implement the actual Kosaraju’s Algorithm. Instead, it finds Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) using a much simpler but slower brute-force method.  Core Idea Used  Two vertices u and v belong to the same SCC if and only if:  There is a path from u → v, and  There is a path from v → u  This program checks both conditions using DFS
